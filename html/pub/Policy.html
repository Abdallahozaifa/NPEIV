                            <p><em>National Partnership to End Interpersonal Violence (NPEIV)</em></p>
                            <p>September 20, 2016</p>
                            <p>​</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
                            <p>The National Partnership to End Interpersonal Violence (NPEIV) advocates for the adoption of a trauma-informed approach in all sectors and systems that affect people across the life span. These include schools, colleges, primary
                                health care, hospitals, child welfare, human services, mental health services, civil and family courts as well as the criminal justice system (e.g. law enforcement, prosecutors, courts and adult corrections and juvenile
                                facilities). These systems and sectors need to fully acknowledge the trauma caused by current or past victimization and the impact on the victims and their families so that they can respond in a manner that is fully supportive,
                                whole person-centered and avoids re-traumatization.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>Trauma-informed care is a universal-precautions approach to engaging people with histories of trauma that recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the role that trauma has played in their lives and in the
                                lives of their families and the professionals who work with them. Trauma may result from an event, series of events and/or circumstances that an individual can experience as threatening or as physically or emotionally harmful.
                                Such events can have an adverse effect on an individual’s functioning and physical, emotional and/or spiritual well-being. Although many people who experience trauma will go on with their lives without lasting negative
                                effects, others will have difficulties and experience traumatic stress reactions. There may be a reluctance to trust others including service providers. Worse, systems as currently designed may actually cause or exacerbate
                                trauma.
                            </p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>Trauma-informed care is grounded in an understanding of the neurological, biological, psychological, and social impact of trauma on the person as well as the heavy burden those effects can have on individuals, families, and
                                communities. A trauma-informed approach can be implemented in any type of service setting or organization. It is distinct from trauma-specific interventions or treatments that are designed specifically to address the consequences
                                of trauma and to facilitate healing.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Impact of Trauma</strong></p>
                            <p>For some people, reactions to a traumatic event are temporary, whereas others have enduring physical and mental health consequences (e.g., complex post-traumatic stress disorder, life functioning issues, biopsychosocial impairment,
                                and medical problems). Others may not meet established criteria for specific disorders but can still experience trauma-related symptoms. In addition, individuals in relationship with the survivor may experience vicarious
                                trauma and/or compassion fatigue. For that reason, even if an individual does not meet diagnostic criteria for trauma-related disorders, it is important to recognize that trauma may affect him or her in significant ways.</p>

                            <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
                            <p>A program, organization, or system that is trauma-informed is one that creates a contextual milieu and a culture of delivering care and services to people impacted by trauma in a way that:</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>Realizes the impacts of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma and vicarious trauma in clients, families, staff, and others involved with the system;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices; and,</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Seeks to actively mitigate re-traumatization and encourage self-care.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>
                            <p>A trauma-informed approach reflects adherence to key principles that set forth a methodology and terminology rather than a prescribed set of practices or procedures. These principles can be implemented across all types of settings
                                although terminology and application may be setting or sector specific:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Safety – Ensuring physical and emotional safety, through better communication,</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Trustworthiness and Transparency – Making tasks clear, maintaining boundaries,</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Choice – Prioritizing consumer choice and control,</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Collaboration and Mutuality – Sharing power with consumers, and,</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Empowerment -- Skill-building, acknowledging and strengthening resilience.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Culture and Trauma</strong></p>
                            <p>It is critical to understand that the way in which people perceive or react to trauma can be influenced by their culture (e.g. gender, age, ability, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, geographical location, socio-economic
                                status, family group, immigration status) or the historic, systemic or intergenerational transmission of trauma as well as the intersectionality of these factors.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Rates of traumatic stress are disproportionately high among diverse and vulnerable populations and cultures.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Some traumas may have greater impact on particular populations because those traumas represent a significant disruption to their cultural practices or ways of life.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Culture can influence which events are perceived as traumatic, how an individual interprets and assigns meaning to the trauma.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Culture influences how people convey traumatic stress through behavior, emotions, and thinking. It can also provide a source of strength, unique coping strategies, and specific resources.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Studies have revealed trauma-informed service settings have better outcomes including a demonstrated improvement in daily functioning and a decrease in trauma reaction, substance use, and mental health symptoms. Trauma-informed
                                        services for children lead to higher self-esteem, improved relationships and increased safety.</p>

                                    <p>Trauma-informed services may have a positive effect on housing stability and can lead to decreased utilization of crisis-based services.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Trauma-informed, integrated services are cost-effective; providing improved outcomes without substantial increases in costs.</p>
                                </li>

                            <p>​</p>
                            <p><em>National Partnership to End Interpersonal Violence (NPEIV)</em></p>
                            <p>October 2, 2015</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>The National Partnership to End Interpersonal Violence (NPEIV) calls for the elimination of all forms of corporal punishment of children. Corporal punishment is defined as the use of physical force for the purpose of correction
                                or control of the child’s behavior with the intentional or incidental result of causing pain or discomfort to the child. Physical force in the form of hitting is often referred to as spanking, swatting, whipping, popping,
                                smacking, slapping, or paddling – all used in the name of discipline. NPEIV is committed to ending all hitting of children.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>NPEIV professionals are in a strategic position to educate parents as well as individuals who work with children and families about the risk factors associated with the use of corporal punishment. Effective parenting does not
                                require physical punishment. Parents need to be informed about the harmful effects of corporal punishment, educated about age-specific expectations for child skills and behavior, and taught and encouraged to use parenting
                                approaches that teach children limit setting, self-regulation, and respect for self and others. Appropriate discipline can assist children in developing healthy emotional balance, the ability to tolerate and regulate frustration
                                and tension, and provide the foundation to behave in socially acceptable ways. Children need consistent and age-appropriate guidance based in support, nurturance, and positive regard by all adults in role-model positions.
                                Open communication between children and every adult in their lives is essential to helping children learn limit setting, acceptable behavior, responsibility, and adult self-discipline. NPEIV advocates for discipline practices
                                that will develop caring, responsible, and self-disciplined individuals and recommends parenting strategies that will nurture, teach, and guide children and adolescents while supporting and promoting the child’s dignity.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN CRC), adopted in November 1989, specifies that all governments who ratified the Convention must take appropriate measures to protect children from all forms of physical
                                or mental violence, including corporal punishment (1). The UN CRC strongly supports parents providing nonviolent guidance and direction to their children. In schools, administrators and teachers are to take into account
                                the child’s “human dignity” and eliminate any discipline practices that may cause physical or mental harm. Globally, over forty-six countries have national laws banning any form of corporal punishment of children, even
                                within their homes.&nbsp;Hitting family members other than children, as well as hitting acquaintances or strangers, is considered assault and a crime. Children, too, have the right and need to be afforded the same consideration.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>Therefore, in a commitment to promote quality safe and nurturing environments where children can grow and develop to their full potential, NPEIV calls for the elimination of all forms of corporal punishment of children in homes,
                                schools, and all settings throughout society. NPEIV pledges an active role to inform our allied professionals, policy makers, and the general public about the risk factors associated with corporal punishment of children.</p>

                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><em>National Partnership to End Interpersonal Violence (NPEIV)</em></p>
                            <p>August 2015</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>The National Partnership to End Interpersonal Violence (NPEIV) is committed to ending all forms of sexual violence against all people across the lifespan. The NPEIV recognizes that the response to sexual violence in law and
                                society has been pervasively and disproportionately ineffective. Therefore, NPEIV is committed to (1) providing leadership to identify the root causes of such ineffective response and recommend legal and policy reforms
                                along with strategies for implementation via legislative, judicial and executive branch actions at the state and federal level and (2) collaborating with the diverse group of disciplines and stakeholders at all levels to
                                devise complimentary primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs and policies to eliminate sexual violence.[1]</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>Sexual violence is both a human and civil rights issue. The impact of sexual violence is felt in all communities by survivors of all ages, classes, and genders. The secrecy and shame that are common aftereffects of sexual assault
                                contribute to a well acknowledged lack of reporting amongst all victims. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately state how many people are victims of sexual violence, and who the perpetrators are. What can be stated with
                                confidence is that an unconscionable number of children and adults experience sexual violence.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>The aftermath of sexual violence can affect all areas of a survivor’s life including, but not limited to, interpersonal relationships, reproductive, physical and mental health, as well as the overall sense of safety and spiritual
                                well-being. The cultural and historical experiences of different groups also play a significant role in the sexual violence narrative. As such, it is important to recognize how institutional racism and gender bias have
                                exacerbated the experiences of survivors from certain groups (such as women and ethnic minority and LGBTQ communities). Adequately addressing these impacts must be a part of developing a holistic, trauma-informed, and systemic
                                approach to reducing the epidemic levels of sexual violence in our society.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>“Sex” and “gender” based violence can be redressed in a variety of legal venues, including criminal and civil court. It can also constitute a “civil rights” violation and be addressed not only in criminal and civil court, but
                                also in grievance procedures, especially in connection with employment and education. Many states also have civil rights statutes and constitutional provisions that extend the scope of legal protection to all areas of public
                                life, and in some jurisdictions, to private life as well.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>Sexual violence is often the subject of politicized controversies, fueled by misconceptions about gender norms and the underlying reasons and motivations behind perpetration. These misconceptions perpetuate harmful ideas about
                                sexual violence and exacerbate distrust between groups, making partnerships among key stakeholders in the fight to end sexual violence difficult to establish and maintain. The degree of tolerance for sexual violence in
                                the cultural environment deters reporting and inhibits legal redress in civil and criminal courts, as well as in military, educational, tribal, and workplace settings. In turn, society’s awareness and understanding of the
                                problem as a public concern is diminished, health and safety are compromised, and survivors are less likely to achieve justice and/or obtain necessary support and treatment.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Fundamental Principles:</strong></p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>The NPEIV approach to sexual violence policy evolves from the fundamental principles of autonomy, equality, voice, access to justice, access to services, public health and safety, and prevention. Each of these principles is
                                defined below and will serve as the NPEIV guideposts as we seek to identify laws and policies that best promote these principles or, conversely, prevent these principles from being realized in society.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Autonomy:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p>The freedom of an individual to make un-coerced, informed, intelligent, and voluntary decisions, and to have laws and policies that prioritize and promote concepts of personal autonomy and bodily integrity as fundamental human
                                and constitutional rights.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Gender Equality:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p>Gender equality in the context of sexual violence means such violence is redressed in all legal venues at a rate and in a manner equal to the redress of other forms of violence, free from unjust skepticism and stereotypes,
                                and under exactly the same substantive and procedural legal standards and protections as violence that occurs on the basis of other protected class categories such as race and national origin.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Voice:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Voice means having the right to be heard in all legal venues whenever a victim’s substantive or procedural rights are threatened or violated, whether by the state or private actor, and irrespective of established precedent
                                providing such right to be heard.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Access to Justice:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Access to justice means having an enforceable right to seek redress of all harms related to sexual violence in all legal venues, including a right to judicial review.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Access to Services:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p>Access to services means having an enforceable right to receive trauma-informed treatment, advocacy, and support related to all harm associated with sexual violence.</p>
                            <p><strong>Public Health and Safety:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p>Current responses to sexual violence typically focus on intervention after an assault has occurred. Public health approaches to sexual violence direct our efforts on prevention of sexual violence before it is perpetrated. Public
                                health approaches also move beyond ensuring the health of individuals, to the health and safety of an entire population by addressing risk and protective factors related to all levels of social ecology.</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Prevention:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Prevention focuses on all efforts (primary, secondary, tertiary) intended to stop the perpetration of unhealthy, harmful, dangerous, and illegal behavior and acts, as well as victimization and re-victimization by others. The
                                prevention of sexual violence involves understanding both risk and protective factors related to the promotion, inhibition, and elimination of its perpetration</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><span style="font-size:14px">[1] This policy statement is intended to provide an overarching framework from which to view all types of sexual violence.&nbsp; Additional position papers addressing specific types of sexual violence will be written separately.

Research demonstrates that long term harm is done to children who live with and/or witness domestic violence and sexual abuse. The outcomes include physical injuries, behavioral disorders, traumatic reactions, and often lifetime illnesses, along with a reduced life expectancy. NPEIV is committed to federal legislation to ensure that child safety from violence and abuse is the first and highest priority in all state and federal court determinations.</span></span>

NPEIV supports the enactment of federal legislation to establish an effective oversight mechanism, such as a Violence Against Children division within the Department of Justice, in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Service’s Administration of Children and Families, to review high profile cases, in which children have been placed with alleged perpetrators of violent or abuse crimes, as well as statues and policies that may lead to children being placed in situations that have potential risks. The purpose of such an oversight entity would be to assure Federal monies are not spent increasing harm to children. A centralized entity would serve as a repository of longitudinal data on incidence and prevalence rates among children who are ordered to live with alleged perpetrators. This oversight entity would have responsibility for establishing best practices to ensure the prioritization of a thorough law enforcement and child protective services investigations, and child safety during all investigations and determinations related to children.</span></span>

For example, child support legislation has resulted in abusers seeking and gaining sole or joint custody to avoid paying child support. Federal grants and legislation should be review to make sure that federal funding priorities ensure child safety and due process. Grants can offer incentives to states to disconnect child support from parenting time, to presume children of a certain age will be allowed to testify in legal proceedings in the absence of clear and convincing proof that testifying will cause them harm, to utilize the civil preponderance of evidence standard of proof to ensure child safety, and to lower the standard of judicial review in cases where allegations of abuse are made such that the appellate court reviews the matter "de novo" or under a "plain error" rule rather than "abuse of discretion".</span></span>

Models should be reviewed in various states that represent best practice approaches to family court procedures and decision-making, and these findings should be used in judicial training and public awareness approached.</span></span>

                            <p><br></p>
                            <p><em>Interdisciplinary Group on preventing School and Community Violence</em></p>
                            <p>December 2012</p>
                            <p><br></p>
                            <p>The undersigned school violence prevention researchers and practitioners and associated organizations wish to comment on the tragic acts of violence at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which have shaken the nation, and express
                                our deepest condolences to families and loved ones of the victims and the entire Newtown community. We all share a common priority: Keeping our children safe. We need to come together in our communities to share our grief
                                and talk about how we can move forward in light of this tragic event. This document updates the School Shootings Position Statement that was disseminated nationally following the tragic school-related shootings of 2006.</p>
                            <p><br>It is important to emphasize that our concern is not limited to schools. The Connecticut tragedy is referred to as a school shooting, but it is better described as a shooting that took place in a school. It is also relevant
                                to consider the hundreds of multiple casualty shootings that occur in communities throughout the United States every year. Few of them occur in schools, but of course are especially tragic when they occur. Yet children
                                are safer in schools than in almost any other place, including for some, their own homes.</p>
                            <p><br>While schools are of paramount concern, the location of a shooting is not its most important feature, although it is the most visible. From the standpoint of prevention, what matters more is the motivation behind a shooting.
                                It is too soon to draw conclusions about this case, but in every mass shooting we must consider two keys to prevention: (1) the presence of severe mental illness and/or (2) an intense interpersonal conflict that the person
                                could not resolve or tolerate.</p>
                            <p><br>Inclinations to intensify security in schools should be reconsidered. We cannot and should not turn our schools into fortresses. Effective prevention cannot wait until there is a gunman in a school parking lot. We need
                                resources such as mental health supports and threat assessment teams in every school and community so that people can seek assistance when they recognize that someone is troubled and requires help. For communities, this
                                speaks to a need for increased access to well integrated service structures across mental health, law enforcement, and related agencies. We must encourage people to seek help when they see that someone is embroiled in an
                                intense, persistent conflict or is deeply troubled. If we can recognize and ameliorate these kinds of situations, then we will be more able to prevent violence.</p>
                            <p><br>These issues require attention at the school and community levels. We believe that research supports a thoughtful approach to safer schools, guided by four key elements: Balance, Communication, Connectedness, and Support,
                                along with strengthened attention to mental health needs in the community, structured threat assessment approaches, revised policies on youth exposure to violent media, and increased efforts to limit inappropriate access
                                to guns and especially, assault type weapons...</p>

                            <p>The&nbsp;National Partnership to End&nbsp;Interpersonal&nbsp;Violence Across the Lifespan (NPEIV) supports the elimination of the civil and criminal statutes of limitation for child sexual abuse. In recognition of the numerous
                                barriers that survivors of child sexual abuse have to reporting the abuse, perpetrators and institutions that failed to prevent the abuse should be held criminally and civilly accountable at any time. NPEIV further supports
                                the retroactive elimination of civil statutes of limitation for child sexual abuse. Allowing survivors to file civil lawsuits for past abuse can identify perpetrators who may still be abusing children, and thus protecting
                                children from further abuse.</p>
