                    So, I want a div, with a class centered to be centered within the container. I may use a row if there are multiple divs, but for now I just want a div with size of one column centered within the container (12 columns). I am also not
                    sure the above approach is good enough as the intention is not to offset the div by half. I do not need free spaces outside the div and the contents of the div shrink in proportion. I want to empty space outside the div to be evenly
                    distributed (shrink till the container width == one column).
